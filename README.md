# Slate

"The world is your slate. You get to write on it, layer by layer."

## Overview

**S**L**ATE** (Sparse Automatic Transformation Environment) is a Python package designed to simplify the representation and manipulation of sparse or compressed matrices through a hierarchical, modular system. By providing composable primitives like diagonal, truncated, and COO (Coordinate List) bases, SLATE allows for flexibility and automatic transformations between different matrix representations.

SLATE aims to be **versatile** and **structure**, making it ideal for users who need a flexible environment to work with matrix and tensor computations without the constraints of optimization or efficiency requirements.

## Features

- **Composable Primitives**: Use diagonal, truncated, COO, and other bases to build complex matrix representations.
- **Hierarchical Basis**: A modular and hierarchical approach to represent matrices and tensors.
- **Automatic Transformations**: Seamlessly switch between different matrix representations.
- **Sparse Representation**: Handle large, sparse matrices in an intuitive way.
- **Customization**: Combine and expand matrix basis in any configuration you need.

## Installation

You can install SLATE directly via pip:

```bash
pip install slate
```
